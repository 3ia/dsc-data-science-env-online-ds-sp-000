Jupyter Notebook is a tool that allows you to mix comments in-between your code snippets so you can document and share your thinking process and make it easier for others to review, replicate and expand on your work. It's also what we're using for almost all of our lessons in this course!\n", "* **Anaconda** - Anaconda is one of the most popular ways for data scientists to install Python and Jupyter Notebook on their computers. It also provides package management and virtual environments so you can get all the latest data science tools running like NumPy, SciPy, and Tensorflow, and so you can use different versions of Python and your packages for different projects without them conflicting with each other.\n", "* **Git** - Git is a version control system. It\u2019s a way of keeping track of all the changes made across your project. Think of it like \u201ctrack changes\u201d in Word - but with the ability to track changes across multiple documents. At Flatiron School, we use Git to keep track of all of the lessons we create and all the changes we make to them.\n", "* **GitHub** - GitHub is a website where data scientists (and programmers) can save their work in case their computer breaks, and share it with their team or the world! At Flatiron School, we store all of our lessons on GitHub.\n", "\n", "It\u2019s going to take us a few minutes to get this all installed, but once we do, not only will you be set-up for working through the course, but you\u2019ll also have a professional data science setup on your computer for any future courses or projects you want to work on!\n", "\n", "## Computer Prerequisites\n", "There are many amazing computing devices available these days, but not all of them will allow you to do data science.

You must make sure you're running the learn-env kernel whenever you're working in a Jupyter Notebook.\n", "\n", "If for any reason you don't see the learn-env option in the drop-down list of kernels, exit the notebook in the browser, close down the notebook server, and in the terminal type `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=learn-env` - that will add the learn-env to your list of kernels and when you restart the Jupyter Notebook server and then open a notebook, you'll be able to select the learn-env option from the list of kernels.\n", "\n", "## Summary\n", "\n", "Congratulations!
